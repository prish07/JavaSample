# JavaSample
 The program in MyClass.java demonstrates a simple Java application that manages student data using object-oriented principles. It creates a StudentManager instance to add students, save their information to a file, and load the information back from the file. The saveStudentsToFile method writes student data to a file in CSV format, while the loadStudentsFromFile method reads the data from the file and populates a new StudentManager instance. This program showcases file handling, data management, and basic operations on custom objects in Java.
